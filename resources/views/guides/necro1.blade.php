<div><span style="font-size: medium;"> Hi! I'm Undyn<span style="color: #111213;">e</span>, a Lv393 Necromancer. I noticed there wasn't really an In-Depth(or updated) Necromancer guide, so here's my attempt at one. <br /> Since Necromancer isn't very well known or talked about, most the information here will be observations from my time as a Necro, and information from other Necros. If you have any additional information, suggestions, usable equipment, etc, please comment and tag me below, and I'll gladly add it!<br /><br /> *To avoid confusion for newer players, I will only add information on currently available content. Future equipment, Crystas, Skills, etc is welcomed, but I will only add it to the guide as it becomes available.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><br />Introduction and Requirements</span><br />
<div><a>SPOILER: Click to show</a></div>
<div data-tag="spoiler"><span style="color: #111213; font-size: medium;"> Necromancer is the newest addition to the wizard tree, and is the most defensive/supportive type of wizard. Necro can be an effective, fun, and flexible class to play!<br /><br /> From being able to tank, to being ranged dps, as well as support, Necro can do it all with some success. Feel free to explore (and share!) Your builds and any information you find here.<br /><br /></span><hr /><span style="color: #111213; font-size: medium;">First, to become a Necromancer (Apprenticeship/Full) you need to meet a few requirements.These include:<br /><br />Apprenticeship<br /> -Lv120 Wizard<br /> -Dark blast 3I~Skill books~Chiro in Rokoko windhole, Civil in dragonlord island(area you're sent to after defeating the boss), Raid Box A/Rare mob Gilgobble.<br /> -Fire Lance/Ice spear 3~Maror, Sofya City Cathedral~Stoking Fire Poker and Ice Sticks Tricks~Quests<br /> -Thunderbolt 1~Nesri, Saterica City (presidents office to the left of the stairs)~Thunder enlightening~Quest<br /> -Mana recharge 3~Kleya city~Alchemist Eludo~Advanced Magical Recover (?)<br /><br />Full class-<br /> -Apprentice Necromancer Lv140.</span></div>

<div><a>SPOILER: Click to show</a></div>
<div data-tag="spoiler"><span style="color: #111213; font-size: medium;"> As I said in the introduction, nothing is set in stone yet, and Necromancer has a lot of potential to be played however you want. That being said, here's just a few builds that work really well!<br /></span><hr /><span style="color: #111213;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Skill spammer</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> Int&gt;Dex&gt;Vit&gt;Gl/Bl</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> This build gives the overall highest damage with good survivability at higher levels. Int for high Matk, MP, as well as Wraith dmg. Dex for decreased cast time and a small Matk boost, as well as more Wraith dmg, Vit for more HP and Def, and Bl/Gl for a bit more Matk, Eva (if using green lines) or MP (if using blue lines). Could also go heavier on Vit for more HP, it helps you take a hit while cemetery is ending.<br /></span></span><hr /><span style="color: #111213;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Autoskill (Magic Autoskill)</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> Int&gt;Dex&gt;Agi=Vit </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> This is my personal recommendation for an auto build, you can quite easily use this build with magic autoskill for respectable damage and higher survival than the spammer route. Int for Mp, Matk, and Wraith dmg again, Dex for Hit rate and reduced delay/Cast time and additional Wraith dmg, Just enough Agi for Max aspd (or 256 if building for evasion) and however much Vit you feel comfortable with (I recommend 150 for Struggler&rsquo;s hidden Matk boost and a bit of extra bulk).<br /><br /></span></span><hr /><span style="color: #111213;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Snead Claw (Via <a title="@madara" href="/user/1945">Tilt*Madara</a></span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: medium;">)</span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> Int&gt;Crt&gt;Dex&gt;Agi=Vit</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> Very similar to magic auto, just with much less gear versatility at the cost of much more stable Dps. Add just enough Agi for max Aspd (256 if building for Eva) Int for MaxMp and Matk, and Wraith Dmg, Crt for more Melee dmg/Crt rate, and enough Vit to be comfortable with your survival. Str is also an option to benefit more from Pex Earring, Dex is less necessary unless you want quicker cast time,less delay, and slightly higher poison Dmg.it will also increase Wraith dmg <br /></span></span></div>

<div data-tag="spoiler">Necromancers have many skills to help them defend themselves and support their party, as well as your wraith when solo.<br /><br />Solo MQ/Boss farming BEFORE 260<br /><br /> 1.At the beginning of battles, you'll usually find yourself using a spell of your choice (I'd recommend Soul crush for lethargy, or thunderbolt for paralysis) to grab the targets attention from a distance. Then, you summon your Bone Knight(or Skeleton, depending on level), who will take the targets attention.<br />*A resist set is very helpful here.<br /><br /> 2.Once your Wraith has the boss's attention, now get yourself into position to deal damage (Auto builds will want to stay closer to the boss, skill users will want to back away a bit) and use cemetery, then drain. <br /><br /> 3. From here, just watch your aggro bar. If you start stealing hate, or your Wraith is nearly dead, simply switch to your MP set,use Soul Return(Or Death Cry if you have it), then quickly resummon them (Paralysis makes this much safer). You can support your Wraith with lethargy and paralysis to make them last longer, but it's not always necessary.<br />*The issue with Ailments disappearing when resummoning seems to have been fixed. Thanks Asobimo lol...&nbsp;<br /><br /> 4.Just rinse and repeat step 3, make sure you keep Cemetery and Drain going, if Cemetery is ending and you can't recast immediately (it has a 3 second cooldown after ending) switch to your resist set to make sure you get it going again, or time the bosses attacks and paralyze them to minimize your chances of being hit by an AoE. Bosses will be slow, but you'll never play a safer solo class when well equipped. After 220, Your dps is much better. You can effectively replace Soul return with Death Cry for the dmg boost. If you also have Corpse Burst, you can follow Death cry with Corpse for even more additional dmg. Debuff bosses will more or less keep this strategy relevant even after Oversoul.<br /><br />PT Play.<br /><br /> 5.Pt play is more of the same really, but here you'll really want to keep lethargy+paralysis on the target if you're tanking or dealing dps(especially when tanking, your lack of pt defense skills is what hurts your tanking ability). Aggro also becomes more of an issue here. If you see the boss turn to another player, resummom immediately. That will add any aggro you've accumulated to what the Bone Knight had, which is usually enough to keep aggro.<br />*Using Bone Knight here is mandatory if tanking, skeleton just can't keep up.<br /><br /> 260+ Playstyle<br />So I felt the Playstyle shifts so dramatically after you aquire Oversoul that it is worth explaining separately. I will leave the previous explanation as it is still somewhat valid for earlier gameplay.<br /><br />Oversoul is a huge buff to Necromancer. It will make you significantly stronger in every aspect, so aim to use it as much as possible.&nbsp;<br /><br />Tanking(Bone Knight): You now outclass the Bone Knight itself in tanking ability. When possessing Bone Knight, you do significantly more dmg with Corpse Burst, attract much more Hate with Corpse Burst, and have dramatically increased Resistance/HP.&nbsp;<br /><br />Pt: <br />&nbsp;-Aim to keep aggro while still building up the Sacrifice charges neccesary for the next boss kill. You don't always need to build maximum charge up, it really depends on the boss and how fast the kill is.<br />&nbsp;-If it's less than 10 seconds, you only need 1 charge per run. Adjust accordingly to how fast the Pt you're in kill<br />&nbsp;-For Longer bosses, Use phantom for your Sacrifice(she takes 0% of your accumulated hate). Using skeleton quickly drains your aggro, and in pts without a servant this becomes a big issue.<br />-For debuff bosses, it's wise to build aggro by possessing Oversoul (Bone Knight) and simply transfer it by summoning another Knight before the debuff.<br /><br />Solo: Aggro? Who cares! Go crazy with whatever you want.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;-If you're nearly dead, simply back off and summon your Knight. This will give you time to heal with Drain and Javelin.<br />&nbsp;<br />Dps (Phantom): Welcome to what makes Necromancer a respectable dps class. Personal tank+ Mid to high dps is a strong combo for solo farming.<br /><br />Pt:<br />&nbsp;-Try to alternate between Death Cry and Corpse Burst. The combo I use most often is Corpse Burst&gt;Summon Skeleton&gt;Deathcry&gt;Repeat, Cemetery as needed.. This combo is especially helpful when the tank has aggro issues, as skeleton removes half your hate per summon. After you have an acceptable amount of Sacrifice, just go crazy with Corpse Burst.<br />&nbsp;-Dont be a "Selfish dps" as I call them. If you have support abilities (Mp heal mainly, but Lethargy will significantly increase the survival of your entire pt) use them! Mp heal is a valuable support skill, as is Soul Crush.<br />&nbsp;-Be flexible. It's part of what a Necromancer is. If your tank is having trouble or dies, try to cover as the "tank" until they can step back in. Bone Knight is a valuable tool for your pt as well, and some quick thinking can turn a bad situation around.<br /><br />Solo:<br />&nbsp;-Play more carefully. If you're using phantom, be ready to resummon your Knight at any moment. Paralyze when Cemetery gets close to ending and prioritize recasting it.<br />&nbsp;-As with pt farming, make sure you're preparing for the next kill. It's much easier when you can go at your own pace, but it becomes more dangerous to do so since your knight is pretty much your survival xD. Paralyze before Sacrificing, it'll make it much safer.<br />&nbsp;-Javelin is great as a utility skill when possessing Phantom due to the passive Dark Magic% bonus from Oversoul. If you do take a hit when cemetery is ending, Drain+Javelin will quickly heal the dmg you received.<br /><br />AoE (Skeleton): Since you're unlikely to be using this in bosses, which is where a pt is normally used, I'll just lump the strategies into one. Overall, this is the simplest to explain.<br /><br />-Kill it fast is your goal here xD. Corpse Burst is incredibly Spammable with high dps. Just watch your Necromance Charges.<br />-Try to mix Death Cry into your spamming, as little downtime as possible between possessions is key here.<br /><br />Necromancer is definitely a viable class now, I'd encourage anyone who's been on the fence to go for it.</div>
<hr /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><span style="color: #111213;">Why Play Necromancer?</span></span>
<div><a>SPOILER: Click to show</a></div>
<div data-tag="spoiler"><span style="color: #111213;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> -Very strong survival skills, you'll often outlive most if not all other classes at your Lv<br /> -Incredibly flexible. You can tailor a build to what YOU like to play thanks to the decreased need for high survival stats/gear.<br /> -All around great class. It can do a little of everything, solo safely, tank bosses well, deal dps, and even support (and for skill users, heal) your party with debuffs and skills.<br /><br /> Sounds pretty great, right? Well, as with every class, it has a few downsides too.<br /><br /> -You're a Jack of all trades, but a master of none. You won't be a better tank than a Paladin, or better Dps than an Enchanter, or a better support/healer than Servants and Bishops, but you'll be able to do a little bit of it all at once.<br /> -parties tend to be less accepting of even higher Lv Necromancers (for now at least).<br /> -requires quite a bit of attention to play. It's not like Gladi or Samu where you buff, run in, kill boss by spamming one/two buttons, repeat. It requires a lot of attention and practice to play the class well, but also makes for a much more engaging play style.</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></span></div>
<hr /><span style="color: #111213;"><span style="font-size: x-large;">Beginner's Guide<br /></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> This section is more geared towards new players, or people new to the wizard tree. If you're experienced with wizards, or have no problem raising funds/leveling, feel free to skip this section.</span></span>

<div data-tag="spoiler"><span style="color: #111213; font-size: medium;"><br /> If my guide so far convinced you to continue on your journey into the dark magics, great! Welcome to the Club!<br /><br /> To begin with, try to get your Vit to 120 as soon as possible for HP and defense (you won't be doing much damage with Int/Dex at this Lv anyway, but you'll be dying a lot without the Vit). When that's at 120(~Lv 40) , split every level's Stat points 2/1 between Int(2) and Dex(1). You'll continue this for awhile, so get comfortable. Get your Dex high enough to speed up Ice Spear's cast time(Ideally ~1 second) then go full int. By the point you have low Ice spear cast time, you should have the option to become an Apprentice Necromancer! As well as settling on your build of choice. But that's for later, let's continue. Starting with how you'll get to there.<br /><br />So by 120, ideally you should have:<br />120 Vit<br />160 Int<br />80 Dex<br /><br /> At lower levels, Necromancer is somewhat tough. I'd recommend doing the standard quests to Lv up, skeletons, broken staffs, etc(check out Krish's quest guide for details on quests, he recommends the better Exp quests per town too). DO THESE WITH PTS, I cannot stress this enough. Necro needs friends (aside from the ones they summon) if you're not well geared/built. <br /><br /> Do these until you get to Lv 50. I'd mix MQs (Mission/Main Quest, Blinking blue dot on the mini map) in with this phase, it'll make it more fun/less monotonous, as well as giving you an idea of where things are located. Now your skill quest fun begins. <br /><br /> -Head to Diel village where you'll get a quest called &ldquo;Magical Power Recovery&rdquo; from Katie (npc in the largest building). Complete this quest, then head to Witch Hunter woods, near Rokoko city. <br /> -Rita (Npc in the witch's shack) will give you a quest called &ldquo;Makings of a Magician&rdquo;, Complete this<br /> -Now, hunt the Kijimus in the witchhunter woods for a rare item called Recovering MP 3. Use this item, and you're ready to become a Wizard!<br /><br /> Head back to Rita with Mana Mastery Lv 3, and Mana Recovery Lv 3, Where she will give you the option to become an Apprentice Wizard. Accept, then you get 2 new spells. Fire Lance for now will be your main spell.continue grinding quests (and Occasional MQs) while making friends. Once you have a few people around your Lv who you hang out with, try starting MQ together. More people helps early on in MQ.<br /><br /> Continue grinding mobs you can kill in one hit, and mixing in MQ until you hit lv 70, when you can become a true wizard! You get another great skill, Drain. This will greatly increase your survival in MQ, and now's the time to seriously start MQ. But first, finding a guild is your next step. Go to the community tab, Group Chats, then cycle through until you find the &ldquo;Seek Guild&rdquo; Tab. Find a guild that looks good (one that speaks your language pretty much) and join up. Guilds are great, full of higher Lvs who are (usually) happy to help new players.<br /><br /> Your guild can probably answer most questions you have from here, so we'll focus on Leveling now. Keep going through MQ (ideally with friends) and grinding where you can. Once you pass the boss named Halios, you can participate in raids back in sofya city. Aim to get into a Lv 140 raid, there's an npc near the back of the town who sends you to the raid rooms. Here you're getting free experience, and stuff to sell to upgrade equipment.<br /><br /> Beads, Abilities on gear, And Empty Crystas(Made at the alchemist next to the shop) are what you'll want to sell here, prices are normally available in sofya if you ask. Once you've gotten a decent rod (Necro wand ns will work, watch out for that -20% HP since you're not a Necromancer yet) and some basic equipment with int+7 xtals in them (int+7 sells for about 20m each in stalls, but it's a good investment) you're ready to really start playing. I'd say keep raiding until you're Lv 120, from there you can finish any skill quests you haven't yet.<br /><br />These include:<br /> -Ice spear/Fire Lance Lv3 from Maror (Wizard job change npc)<br /> -Mana charge Lv3 from Eludo(alchemist npc in kleya)<br /> -Thunderbolt Lv1 from one of the NPCs in satericas presidents office(walking in, left of the stairs)<br /> -Dark blast lv3 (skill book, Lv1 is from chiros in Rokoko windhole, Lv2 is from a rare mob, civil near Kaiser (this is where friends/guild is needed) , and Lv3 is from raid boxes you get from raid 140! Convenient right? <br /><br /> Once you hit Lv120, with all the above skills, head to Molgore Mauseleum near Wibo (North exit from Wibo City, head to the Red map change marker on the left edge of the map) then descend to the bottom, and speak with Calavera there. She is the npc who turns you into a Necromancer apprentice at 120/Full Necromancer at Lv140, and will be the one who gives you new skills every 20 levels. When you turn apprentice Necromancer, you'll have a much easier time doing MQ solo/tanking for friend's. Drain the boss, then run and summon your skeleton, it works fine until you get your next wraith.<br /><br /> From here, burn MQ, Hard. It'll get much easier as you progress and gain new skills (Particularly Lv 160 skills). At Lv140, come back for the full class, then keep MQing/Grinding. Remember to come back every 20 levels for more skills, and if you're going to be using Agi, Now is the time to do so (either for aspd or Eva) so youll have an easier time with dps/survival. After Lv200-220, start grinding Yardes near Underground Bailune between MQs, from here it's up to you to upgrade gear, Lv up, and become an amazing Necromancer that does the title proud.<br /></span></div>

The key with this set is to generate hate until the hate bar is at the rusty </span><span style="color: #e67b19;">orange </span><span style="color: #111213;">color, right before you start taking aggro.

<div><a>SPOILER: Click to show</a></div>
<div data-tag="spoiler"><br /><span style="font-size: medium;">Necromancer Al's are very similar to other classes, with a few small differences.<br /> -Necromancer skills require much less delay than other magic classes<br /> -Necromancer only specializes in dark magic, so they're free to focus mainly on Matk and Dark Magic%, as well as Autoskill/MaxMp for auto builds.<br /><br /> I'll list the Crystas that work best here, in the same manner as the normal Crysta section.<br /><br /> -Pauk:Dark magic+15%, Light magic-10%<br />Note:Can be used by Auto builds, but due to Dajarte/strong Dark magic autos low proc rate, I wouldn't recommend this unless you have 40%+ auto from other sources)<br />&nbsp;<br /> -Lunange:Dark magic+5%, Melee to Dark+5%<br />Note:same case as Pauk<br /><br /> -Cheltil: Skill delay-1 second, Item delay+0.5 seconds<br /><br /> -Sauro II: Melee +3% to all Elements, All Magic +3%, Delay -0.5 sec, Autoskill +2%<br /><br /> -Sauro III: Melee to all Elements +3% All Magic + 3% Delay - 0.5 sec Autoskill +3% Atk&amp;Matk +30 Neutral Res +5%<br /><br /> -Ouvel: Atk +6% Matk +6% MaxHP -10% MaxMP -10%<br /><br /> -Zazel: Atk +15 Atk +2% Matk +30 Matk +2%<br /><br /> -Parazai: Matk +20 Matk +3% Auto MP recovery +25%<br /><br /> -<span style="color: #d619e6;">Bergen</span>: Matk +3% Atk -3%, Magic evasion +2%<br /><br /> -Glabora: Magic pierce +10% Matk-4%<br /><br /> -<span style="color: #d619e6;">Vatendeth: </span><span style="color: #111213;">Melee/Magic resistance+10%, Hate rise-20%<br /></span><br /> -<span style="color: #d619e6;">Pole</span>: Range cut+15%<br />Notes:Necromancer makes the best use of range cut% equipment, as range cut reduces AoE dmg taken.
